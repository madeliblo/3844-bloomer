							<h1>Introduction</h1>
							<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Feisty</strong>, and this is my remix website. I wouldn't exactly say I'm a novice to digital writing, but I'm most definitely not an expert. Yet, that is. For now, I can be classified as an experienced intermediate.</p>
							<p>My first instances of working with HTML took place in middle school when I would edit my Myspace layouts. I found that, to an extent, editing the code was simple and common sense.
								Basically, I would find words that I knew and changed them to my preferences, like font families and sizing and such, and I learned certain elements that were necessary to the overall coding structure so that I could delete the annoying
								advertisements from whoever created the original codes.</p>
								<p>My first experience working with HTML in college took place last year in Professional Writing with Jen Barton. We created our own advertising websites for vacation homes, and this is where I learned a little bit more in HTML with the help of Lynda.
									Since then, I have gained even more knowledge this year on the overall concept of writing within digital media in several of my current courses and am on my way to becoming an expert in HTML.</p></p>

									<h1>Goals</h1>
									<p>If I would've taken my classes in somewhat of the <i>correct</i> order, I would have been in this class last year, and my experiences would be a lot different than they are now. In other words, I would be a lot less experienced.</p>
									<p>My main interest interconnected with digital media is within technical writing, which involves my primary major of Professional and Technical Writing and my current internship within a division of the Information Technology (IT) department, Network Infratructure &amp; Services (NI&amp;S).</p>
									<p>As a technical writing student and intern, I constantly work with digital media through creating and editing online content. Even though I am not a student of science, I work with technology on a daily basis, and this technological aspect of my learning, especially prevalent within my work at NI&amp;S,
										 parallels with my professional writing to form an interdisciplinary knowledge, making myself somewhat of an ideal VT-shaped student.</p>
										 <p>Though I have gained a lot of experience interning within NI&amp;S, <b>my technical writing journey is far from over</b>. I currently have two more internships lined up over the course of the next year.</p>
										 <p>The first begins in June while I am studying abroad in London. For five weeks, I will work with Datix as a Learning Content Development Intern. While my duties will include designing and developing user learning content, my main goals are to become familiar with new software programs and better understand the differences between British English and American English. By accomplishing these two goals, I will become a more open-minded, diverse technical writer.</p>
										 <p>The second begins in August, in which I will be interning with another division of the IT department, Technology-enhanced Learning and Online Strategies (TLOS). Much like my internship with NI&amp;S, I will work with lead documentation specialists to write and edit technical documentation, such as software tutorials and knowledge base articles. With TLOS, my goals consist of gaining more experience in effectively communicating with subject matter experts and broadening my knowledge on technical writing conventions with the use of a new style guide.</p>
										 <p>Overall, my number one goal is to gain as much technical writing experience as possible so that I am well-qualified for my future career path once I graduate.</p>

						<h1>Remix</h1>
													<p>Below are some quotes I found interesting on the power of digital media and VT-Shaped learning. The purpose of sharing these is to illustrate the importance of our creative abilities to "Rip, Mix, Burn" within modern technology.</p>
													<div class="features">
															<p align="left>">"For the Internet has unleashed <strong>an extraordinary possibility</strong> for many to participate in the process of building and cultivating a culture that reaches <strong>far beyond</strong> local boundaries."</p>

															<p align="right">"Whether it takes pages or a few words, it is the special genius of a common law system, that the law adjusts to the technologies of the time. And <b>as it adjusts, it changes</b>. Ideas that were as solid as rock in one age crumble in another."</p>

															<p align="left">"The challenges of the future require the capacity to work in interdisciplinary teams, engage in critical and creative thinking, collaborate with diverse people, communicate effectively, and conduct oneself with a deep sense of ethics. Students at all levels will be mentored to develop a knowledge base and skills while they are immersed in a culture that unifies multiple disciplines in a field of study within the context of these crucial values."</p>

															<p align="right">Continuously advancing information and communication technologies will <b>enable connections</b> that will obviate the need for place-bound learning or research. In future decades, virtual faculty, student, mentor, or work relationships will be as rich and effective as current face-to-face interpersonal experiences. Within digitally enabled human-centered smart environments we will experiment, prove ideas, and learn from failures.""</p>

															<p align="left">"Steve Jobs, who credited a class in calligraphy and typefaces for part of the human appeal of his computers, insisted that “<strong>technology alone is not enough</strong>—it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing."</p>

															<p align="right">President Tim Sands wants "to prepare students who can tackle the complex global problems and opportunities of the furure. To do that, students need to be adaptable, resilient, and culturally competent, seeing the world through the lens of empathy and our university's motto, <em>Ut Prosim</em> (That I May Serve)."</p>

															<p align="left">"The intersection between the arts and sciences, between liberal and practical education, <b>should not just be a moment in the past</b>, particularly not at a land-grant institution like Virginia Tech."</p>

															<p align="right">"The intersection of [artisanal practices] led to some of the <b>most powerfully creative</b> impulses of the Renaissance."</p>

															<p align="left">"An artist who trained in the sciences, a scientist whose studies began with the arts: What made Leonardo and Galileo who they were had a great deal to do with how their education demanded that they learn, think, and see <b>outside and across</b> boundaries."</p>

															<p align="right">"The concept of VT-shaped learning is more than a philosophy of education; <b>it’s the very foundation of our college</b>.”</p>

															<p align="left">"We will <strong>continuously innovate</strong> to evolve."</p>

							<h2>Individual Work</h2>
							<h3>VT-Shaped Poem</h3>
							<p>Though I am not a poet, I wrote the following untitled poem as my own design of the VT-shaped Student.</p>
<blockquote><p>For us to be properly shaped,<br>
To be ready for what we call the real world,<br>
We need interdisciplinary knowledge:<br>
<p>How effective is a writer<br>
If they cannot synthesize?<br>
What about a scientist<br>
Without the ability to write?<br>
<p>How competent are you<br>
With training in only one discipline?<br>
How qualified are you<br>
Without necessary integration?<br>
<p>As our own president has noted,<br>
"What important problem can be solved<br>
Only by engineers who are trained<br>
Only in engineering, or by poets<br>
Who have mastered only poetry?"<br>
<p>A lack of an integration of knowledge<br>
Is the only thing preventing you<br>
From inventing the future.</blockquote></p>
							<p>I think my poem properly conveys the importance of the VT-shaped concept. Through interdisciplinary knowledge, one is able to be a more diversified, well-rounded student and individual.</p>
							<p>Through my sections on Goals and Reflection, I think I effectively demonstrate my own identity as a VT-shaped student through my daily interactions with technology and digital media. So, the purpose of my poem is to hopefully speak with and connect to a completely different audience than those directly related to English. Though it fits perfectly in my case, I think it is more important to try to relate to others, such as Engineering majors, in regards to how they can broaden their horizons and live up to the standards of a VT-shaped Student by expanding their knowledge across different disciplines.</p>
							<h2>Group Work</h2>
							<p>Below are the two big projects my group and I conducted concerning the VT-shaped Student.</p>
							<h3>T-Shaped Podcast</h3>
							<iframe width="100%" height="100" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/313796572&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
							<p>Our "T-Shaped Podcast" explores the T in the VT-shaped model, which focuses on making connections across one's knowledge base and discovering crosscutting skills that exemplifies their interdisciplinary knowledge.</p>
							<p>In the podcast, an investigator interviewed me and asked me what types of classes I took; I told him that I took classes that combined liberal arts and technology. By taking both types of classes, I was able to use my skills in liberal arts while learning essential web-creation skills I need for the future.</p>
							<p>This project emphasized the disciplinary depth that is achieved through interdisciplinary knowledge and technological literacy. In today's world, technological literacy is a vital part of performing daily rituals, and it is important for one to properly adapt to technology in order to compete with today's society of constant innovation. By talking about my liberal arts and technology classes, I exemplified the T in the VT-shaped model because I am using both in order to succeed.</p>
								<h3>V-Shaped Video</h3>
							 <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2y9VfKEHw4o" frameborder="1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								<p>Our "V-Shaped Video," on the other hand, explores the V in the VT-shaped model, which consists of gaining interdisciplinary knowledge through guided, experiential learning and informal, communal learning. In simpler terms, a student's V consists of learning and gaining experience, through not only classes but also, through internships, volunteering opportunities, and research experiences.</p>
								<p>This project emphasized the equal importance of knowledge gained inside and outside of the classroom. Through extremely amateur acting, we were able to convey that while the hands-on experience from an internship is absolutely essential in learning about a profession, the work performed through that internship would likely not be possible without the knowledge one gains from learning inside the classroom. This type of experiential learning is able to give one a sense of community, in which they learn and apply concepts that are not necessarily guided in a class.</p>

							<h1>Reflection</h1>
							<p>The concept of digital writing and how the plethora of technological advancements have helped it evolve over centuries, decades, and even small increments of years is what intrigues me the most. All of the assigned readings this semester helped me form a better understanding of the impact in technology and, ultimately, digital writing. Creating content through "Rip, Mix, Burn" is a game-changer in today's world of technology because it enables users everywhere the ability to constantly innovate through one another's content. </p>
							<p>The need for something as simple as the VT-shaped Student is something that almost seems like common sense, but I had never put much thought into the concept until taking this course. Of course having knowledge over multiple disciplines, such as technology and simple writing, will make you more qualified in comparison to those who are experienced in only one area of discipline.</p>
							<p>However, how many students actually think about this concept when they are entering college and trying to decide upon a major? I know that if I were presented the VT-shaped model at my own freshman orientation, it probably would have made me think deeper into what I wanted my future career to look like. Being one who has a passion for writing and editing and a joy for learning new technologies, it only makes sense that technical writing would be my career path. The fact that the VT-shaped model is a primary facet of the university's orientations today is a huge step in the right direction for helping students discover themselves as VT-shaped individuals.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, the assigned readings on computing and technological advancements has definitely helped expand my views on digital writing. I guess it is no surprise that people in previous decades would envision their hopes for developments in future technologies in terms of accessibility, but the importance of an all-accessible encyclopedia and the practical needs for transferrable knowledge had never crossed my mind before. Considering these ideas for contributions that have actually formed over the years and the concept of VT-learning, I have come to realize the value and overall essentiality of interdisciplinary knowledge and how the implementation is already making a positive impact for the world.</p>
