							<h1>Introduction</h1>
							<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Maddy</strong>, and this is my remix website. I wouldn't exactly say I'm a novice to digital writing, but I could possibly be categorized as an intermediate. Most definitely not an expert.</p>
							<p>My first instances of working with HTML took place in middle school when I would edit my Myspace layouts. I found that, to an extent, editing the code was simple and common sense.
								Basically, I would find words that I knew and changed them to my preferences, like font families and sizing and such, and I learned certain elements that were necessary to the overall coding structure so that I could delete the annoying
								advertisements for whomever created the original codes.</p>
								<p>I also worked with HTML last year in Professional Writing with Jen Barton. We created our own advertising websites for vacation homes, and this is where I learned a little bit more in HTML with the help of Lynda.
									Now that I am in this course, I hope to gain even more knowledge on the overall concept of general writing and work my way to becoming an expert in HTML.</p></p>

									<h1>Interests</h1>
									<p>I have a lot of interests involving Virginia Tech, but I'm unfortunately not able to act on most of them due to my busy schedule.</p>
									<p>The only interest worth talking about that is interconnected with digital media is my interest in technical writing, which involves my primary major of Professional and Technical Writing and my current internship within Network Infratructure &amp; Services (NI&amp;S).</p>
									<p>As a technical writing student and intern, I constantly work with digital media through creating and editing online content. Even though I am not a student of science, I work with technology on a daily basis, and this technological aspect of my learning, especially prevalent within my work at NI&amp;S,
										 parallels with my professional writing to form the interdisciplinary knowledge, making myself somewhat of an ideal VT-shaped student.</p>

							<h1>Remix</h1>
							<p>Below are some quotes I found interesting on the power of digital media and VT-Shaped learning. The purpose of sharing these is to illustrate the importance of our creative abilities to "Rip, Mix, Burn" within modern technology.</p>
							<div class="features">
									<p align="left>">"For the Internet has unleashed <strong>an extraordinary possibility</strong> for many to participate in the process of building and cultivating a culture that reaches <strong>far beyond</strong> local boundaries."</p>

									<p align="right">"Whether it takes pages or a few words, it is the special genius of a common law system, that the law adjusts to the technologies of the time. And <b>as it adjusts, it changes</b>. Ideas that were as solid as rock in one age crumble in another."</p>

									<p align="left">"The challenges of the future require the capacity to work in interdisciplinary teams, engage in critical and creative thinking, collaborate with diverse people, communicate effectively, and conduct oneself with a deep sense of ethics. Students at all levels will be mentored to develop a knowledge base and skills while they are immersed in a culture that unifies multiple disciplines in a field of study within the context of these crucial values."</p>

									<p align="right">Continuously advancing information and communication technologies will <b>enable connections</b> that will obviate the need for place-bound learning or research. In future decades, virtual faculty, student, mentor, or work relationships will be as rich and effective as current face-to-face interpersonal experiences. Within digitally enabled human-centered smart environments we will experiment, prove ideas, and learn from failures.""</p>

									<p align="left">"Steve Jobs, who credited a class in calligraphy and typefaces for part of the human appeal of his computers, insisted that “<strong>technology alone is not enough</strong>—it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing."</p>

									<p align="right">President Tim Sands wants "to prepare students who can tackle the complex global problems and opportunities of the furure. To do that, students need to be adaptable, resilient, and culturally competent, seeing the world through the lens of empathy and our university's motto, <em>Ut Prosim</em> (That I May Serve)."</p>

									<p align="left">"The intersection between the arts and sciences, between liberal and practical education, <b>should not just be a moment in the past</b>, particularly not at a land-grant institution like Virginia Tech."</p>

									<p align="right">"The intersection of [artisanal practices] led to some of the <b>most powerfully creative</b> impulses of the Renaissance."</p>

									<p align="left">"An artist who trained in the sciences, a scientist whose studies began with the arts: What made Leonardo and Galileo who they were had a great deal to do with how their education demanded that they learn, think, and see <b>outside and across</b> boundaries."</p>

									<p align="right">"The concept of VT-shaped learning is more than a philosophy of education; <b>it’s the very foundation of our college</b>.”</p>

									<p align="left">"We will <strong>continuously innovate</strong> to evolve."</p>

							<h1>Reflection</h1>
							<p>The concept of digital writing and how the plethora of technological advancements have helped it evolve over centuries, decades, and even small increments of years is what intrigues me the most. As you can see in my two previous reading responses, all of the readings helped me form a better understanding of the impact in technology and, ultimately, digital writing. Creating content through "Rip, Mix, Burn" is a game-changer in today's world of technology because it enables users everywhere the ability to constantly innovate through one another's content. </p>
<p>Since I already have somewhat of a background in HTML, though not extensive by any means, this assignment was not all that difficult. I believe the most challenging aspect was using a template from HTML5Up and trying to work around the complex HTML and CSS codes. Though you advised us not to make it too difficult, I figured it would be just the right challenge to attempt. At one point, this particular section of reflection was being overlapped by the side navigation bar, and it took me about thirty minutes to scrutinize the coding and realize I had an extra /div attribute that cancelled out the wrapper feature.</p>
<p>Another facet I found a bit challenging was dealing with the CSS since I am not as familiar with it as I am HTML, so most of the attributes were new to me and sometimes a bit confusing. What I found the most interesting about composing in HTML was my personal control over what went on my website and the satisfaction of the actual creation of it.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, the assigned readings on computing and technological advancements has definitely helped expand my views on digital writing. I guess it is no surprise that people in previous decades would envision their hopes for developments in future technologies in terms of accessibility, but the importance of an all-accessible encyclopedia and the practical needs for transferrable knowledge had never crossed my mind before. Considering these ideas for contributions that have actually formed over the years and the concept of VT-learning, I have come to realize the value and overall essentiality of interdisciplinary knowledge and how the implementation is already making a positive impact for the world.</p>
